1. To create a new Next.js project, you can use the following command:

npx create-next-app my-airdrop-dapp
​

This will create a new Next.js project in the directory `my-airdrop-dapp`.
2. The necessary dependencies for this project include:

web3
@oceanprotocol/squid
​

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

npm install web3 @oceanprotocol/squid
​

3. The smart contract for the airdrop can be created using the following code:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
contract Airdrop is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("Airdrop Token", "ADT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }
    function airdrop(address[] calldata recipients, uint256 amount) public {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
            _transfer(msg.sender, recipients[i], amount);
        }
    }
}
​

This smart contract creates an ERC20 token called "Airdrop Token" with the symbol "ADT". The constructor mints the initial supply of tokens to the deployer's address. The `airdrop` function allows the deployer to airdrop tokens to a list of recipients.
4. The smart contract can be deployed to the blockchain using the following command:

truffle migrate
​

This command will compile the smart contract and deploy it to the blockchain.
5. A web3 provider can be created using the following code:

const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545"));
​

This code creates a web3 provider that connects to the blockchain on port 8545.
6. The web3 provider can be connected to the smart contract using the following code:

const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address);
​

This code creates a contract object that can be used to interact with the smart contract. The `abi` parameter is the ABI of the smart contract, and the `address` parameter is the address of the smart contract.
 
7. The smart contract can be used to airdrop tokens to a list of recipients using the following code:

const recipients = ["0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", "0x9876543210987654321098765432109876543210"];
const amount = 100;
contract.methods.airdrop(recipients, amount).send({from: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"});
​

This code calls the `airdrop` function of the smart contract, passing in the list of recipients and the amount of tokens to airdrop. The `send` function sends the transaction to the blockchain.
8. The airdrop can be verified by checking the balances of the recipients. The following code can be used to check the balance of a recipient:

const balance = await contract.methods.balanceOf("0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890").call();
​

This code calls the `balanceOf` function of the smart contract, passing in the address of the recipient. The `call` function returns the balance of the recipient.
